        question: "What is 80 IAC tax exemption?",
        answer: "Section 80 IAC of the Income Tax Act provides eligible startups with a 100% tax deduction on profits for any 3 consecutive years out of the first 10 years of operation. This exemption is specifically designed to support innovative startups recognized by the Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB)."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the eligibility criteria for 80 IAC tax exemption?",
        answer: "To be eligible, a startup must: (1) be incorporated as a private limited company, LLP, or partnership firm; (2) be registered with DPIIT; (3) have been incorporated on or after April 1, 2016; (4) have a total turnover not exceeding â‚¹100 crores since incorporation; (5) be working towards innovation, development, or improvement of products/processes/services with potential for commercial creation of wealth; and (6) be approved by the Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB)."
      },
      {
        question: "How is 80 IAC exemption different from Angel Tax exemption?",
        answer: "While Angel Tax exemption (Section 56(2)(viib)) provides relief from tax on investments received above fair market value, 80 IAC provides a 100% deduction on profits for 3 consecutive years. Angel Tax exemption focuses on capital received, while 80 IAC focuses on profits generated by the startup. A startup can avail both exemptions if eligible."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does it take to get 80 IAC approval?",
        answer: "The process typically takes 2-3 months from application to approval, including the IMB review. However, the timeline can vary based on the volume of applications, the complexity of your innovation assessment, and any additional information requests from the board."
      },
      {
        question: "Can all DPIIT recognized startups get 80 IAC exemption?",
        answer: "No, DPIIT recognition is necessary but not sufficient for 80 IAC exemption. The startup must additionally be approved by the Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB), which evaluates the innovation, scalability, and potential impact of the business model. Only startups that demonstrate genuine innovation in products, processes, or services are approved for this exemption."
