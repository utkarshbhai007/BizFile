        question: "What are the main annual compliance requirements for a Private Limited Company?",
        answer: "Private Limited Companies must hold board meetings quarterly, conduct Annual General Meeting (AGM), file Annual Return (MGT-7), Financial Statements (AOC-4), maintain statutory registers, file DIR-3 KYC for directors annually, and comply with various event-based filing requirements."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if annual compliance filings are missed?",
        answer: "Late filings incur penalties starting from â‚¹100 per day per form. Prolonged non-compliance can lead to director disqualification, company strike-off, and potential legal action against directors. Regularizing past non-compliance often costs significantly more than staying compliant."
